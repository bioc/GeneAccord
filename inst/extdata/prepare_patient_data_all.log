There were 82 rates of average clonal exclusivity provided.
The average rates will be distorted with a beta distribution and M = alpha + beta = 1000
Additionally, from the 82 patients, the values from the data for all pairs of # clon. excl./ # occurrence across all trees is provided.
From those, it will be sampled 1e+05 times to obtain the test statistic under the null.
This procedure is done for num_patients = 2, ... 3
Generate ECDF for the case where a gene pair is mutated together in 2 patient(s).
Generate ECDF for the case where a gene pair is mutated together in 3 patient(s).
